          <p id="one">“Hope” is the thing with feathers - That perches in the soul - And sings the tune without the words - And never stops - at all</p>
          <p id="two">And sweetest - in the Gale - is heard - And sore must be the storm - That could abash the little Bird That kept so many warm -</p>
          <p id="three">I’ve heard it in the chillest land - And on the strangest Sea - Yet - never - in Extremity, It asked a crumb - of me.</p>
